This package contains new DFT functionalities developed in Kong's group at
MTSU.  The functionalities include:
1. Computation of the Hartree-Fock exchange (HFX) energy density;
2. Computation of the HFX hole;
3. B05 and B13, KP16/B13 implementations.

The name exStrongDFT is a composition of exact exchange, strong correlation, 
and DFT. It is subject to change.

The code was written mainly by Fenglai Liu with design input from Jing Kong
and Emil Proynov. Emil also help in coding up some of the DFT functionals.
Yiting Wang wrote the code for the computation of HFX hole.

Note: This initial release of code is (very) experimental. Please feel free 
to contact me at jing.kong@mtsu.edu if you want to use it.  Your feedback 
will help us to improve it.

Descriptions:

1. HFX energy density: halfjkrho.cpp, espints.cpp, batchexrhomtrx.cpp. The
HFX energy density is calculated in halfjkrho.cpp, which calls espints.cpp
for computing the electrostatic potential of a shell pair. This part of 
code eventually calls cppints on github, an efficient four-center integral
package developed by Fenglai. batchexrhomtrx.cpp is to construct the 
HFX-related part of XC matrix.

	2. HFX hole: halfjkrho.cpp, gaussian.cpp, sphereInt.cpp, coefCalculator.cpp.
doHalfJKRhoXHole in halfjkrho.cpp calls sphereInt the computation of the HFX
hole value at a given interelectronic distance.

3. B05 and B13, KP16/B13: All the Fortran files (*.f). Note that 'kp14' was
used internally for KP16 method because its implementation started in 2014.
